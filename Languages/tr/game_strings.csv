str_npc17_intro_response_2|Evet ,orman güzel, fakat şimdi gitmem gerek
str_npc1_backstory_a|Zor zamanlarda geldin dostum. Ithilien düşman gözcü ve yağmacılarıyla kaynıyor ve bazıları büyük ork ordularının harekette olduğunu söylüyor.Bu iğrenç yaratıkların büyük nehirden geçmemesi için ben ve yönettiğim korucular çoğunlukla başarıya ulaştık.Kaptanım Faramir cesur o yüzden gölgenin üzerimize düşeceğinden korkmuyorum.
str_npc2_backstory_a|Ah, beni düşünmeniz çok zarif doğrusu. Kısa zaman önce onun yönetiminin güvenliğini sağlamak üzere atandım. Gurur verici bir görev,  tabi çok olaylı değilse...
; str_npc3_backstory_a|Well, my old helmet here is getting smaller by the minute and the ground seems wobbly as if I rode a mischievous foil. Ah, if I only hadn't drank all that ale last night - I normally have a good head for drink, so it must have been some nasty orc brew.
str_npc4_backstory_a|Benim adım Gálmynë. Bildiğin gibi işimi yapıyorum,[oyuncu adı]. Bırak da sebebini anlatayım.
; str_npc5_backstory_a|You may have heard tales of my deeds in battles past and forgotten by mortal Men. In the fullness of time this War is yet another time of danger for the Eldar, but it will be the Last War.
str_npc6_backstory_a|Küstahlığımı mazur gör, yabancı, ama buraya fazla ziyaretçi uğramaz ve gelenlerde çok güvenilir görünmüyor. Sadece bir hafta önce, bir cüce göründü... Boşver. Benim adım Silvan elflerinden Luevanna.
; str_npc7_backstory_a|Polite of you to ask, {playername}. We are fighting off incursions from Easterlings and Gundabad orcs, but so far nothing we and our Dale allies can't handle.
; str_npc8_backstory_a|I'm sure you can find some fine volunteers if you speak to the quartermaster in the barracks. As for me, I'm merely a healer and herbalist of modest skills.
str_npc9_backstory_a|Aferin! Bana Gulm derler. Çavuşumu geberttim ve şimdi o snagalar benim için ava çıktı. ^ Değersiz domuz yavrusu gelmişti! Bir keresinde, bir samanlık devriyesi tarafından tuzağa düşürüldük ... ve o kaybetti. "Geri çekilin" diye ciyaklıyor, sonra kaçmaya başlıyordu. Sadece Gulm ve birkaç kişi sıkı durdu ve atlı hücumunu kırdı. Daha sonra sarı saçlıları parçaladık (heh heh heh). Ama eğer bizim gibi güçlü olanlar olmasaydı, hepsi solucan yemeği olurdu!
str_npc10_backstory_a|Ben Durgash'ım
; str_npc11_backstory_a|Nar! Not a tracker, that's who. They threw me out! I tell you they've lost their heads, that's what it is. Curse 'em! First they say I shoot wild, then I run too slow, and then I have a useless snuffler. Garn! If they don't find a rabble for me soon I'll be for the Black Pits, if what I hear is true. I'll make sure some of those Bosses lose their skins sooner than putting me in there!
; str_npc12_backstory_a|I'm in command of a band of lads up here. I'm Gorbag and you'd best learn quick lubber us Uruks are the real bosses 'round here. The Big Bosses makes slips, 'ay, even the Biggest can make mistakes, and always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. They don't even tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. Grr!
; str_npc13_backstory_a|I? I am a grain of soil from southern sands, blown north by cold and dark night winds. I am Lykyada, a Serpent Lord of Haradwaith. Lord of the Gold Serpent, bane of the Black Serpent Tribe, now allied to serve the will of the Dark Lord.
; str_npc14_backstory_a|I am Fuldimir, son of the southern realm of Umbar, south of Harondor, and the Bay of Belfalas, for both are home to my heart and my people. We are the lords of sea and sail, corsairs to some, kin of the Bay of Belfalas for her waters we tame.
; str_npc15_backstory_a|I am Bolzog the Gifted, Setter of Bones, Closer of Cuts, and Shaman of Healing. If you go to war for The Eye, you will no doubt have one or other of your little fellows cut about a bit by pale-faced foresters or the horse-lovers. Now, -nar-nar-nar! - Orcs are easy to replace, Oh Great Leader, but can you replace a Warg? A Giant? A Cave Troll? Shi-shi! No! You need me, the Great Bolzog!
; str_npc16_backstory_a|Well now, it is the stranger who should declare himself first. Nevertheless, I am Varfang of the Balcoth kin... I can tell that you have not yet heard the songs or tales of my land that speak the name of the Balcoth, for the very name would check your courage and fill your heart with woe.
; str_npc17_backstory_a|They call me Dímborn and I work in the woods. It is nice there. I like the woods. Many trees in the woods. I like trees. I've worked in the woods all my life, because I am strong and because I like trees.
; str_npc1_backstory_b|You should know that I am an Ithilien Ranger of Dúnedain descent and valor. I know much of tracking and scouting and my skill with bow and sword is known to the orc. I can also train any soul that's willing to fight the coming Shadow.
str_npc2_backstory_b|Minas Tirith bekçisi olarak, Beyaz Şehri'nde düzen tutmak ve efendim Steward'a hizmet etmek için eğitildim.
str_npc3_backstory_b|Ben Batı Emnet'in bir binicisiyim - beni arkada bırakıp Isen ford'larında devriyeye çıktılar. Davranışlarının yeşil bayrağa layık olduğunu biliyorum, fakat birçoğunun geri dönmemesinden korkuyorum.
str_npc4_backstory_b|Ben asil bir aileden geliyorum ve küçüklüğümden beri nedime olarak Leydi Eowyn'a hizmet etmişimdir. Babam bize bir gün Rohan'ın kalkan kardeşleri olmamız için erkek kardeşlerimizle beraber talim yapmamıza izin verecek bilgeliğe sahipti. Böylece savaşmayı öğrendim.
str_npc5_backstory_b|Lord Elrond beni Lord Celeborn'a göndererek, Rhovanion'un bu bölümünde Savaşta ihtiyaç duyduğu gibi yardım ve tavsiye vermeye çağırdı.
; str_npc6_backstory_b|I like to walk the hidden paths in our beautiful forest. Sometimes I move quietly through the trees and observe the habits of the many woodland animals. The song of a rare bird, the nesting of a wild boar are as beautiful to me as the clash of weapons and great walls are to the Edain.
; str_npc7_backstory_b|I helped improve the Erebor defenses and trained some younger dwarven folk, under the direction of my venerated father Dwalin, as is our custom.
; str_npc8_backstory_b|I have treated my King Brand for constipation, a common malaise affecting men going to war. A light brew of wormwood, and both the bowels and the mind are put at ease.
; str_npc9_backstory_b|So I said to myself, 'Gulm, you want end up as carrion?' and I answered, 'No'.^Next battle, I fell back pretending I was injured. Then, with no one watching, I fell upon my sergeant! Cleaved him almost in half, gharr! Then cut his sidekick snaga nicely^^...Turned out that bloody creeper survived somehow, and started waggling his tongue about all this. Next time I make sure his head is off, gharr...
str_npc10_backstory_b|Ben Isengard'tan Wolf Rideriyim ve izcicilik yapıyorum.
; str_npc11_backstory_b|Ar! It's only 'cause my nose was snotty. An' what good is it wearing my nose out on stones anyhow? Nar! It was those filthy Uruks! Those cursed peaching sneakthiefs! I only lost the scent through giving way to them. They messed up the scent back there, pinching anything they found, and stomping all round the place before I could get there.
; str_npc12_backstory_b|And those Nazgul give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving in the city. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em.
; str_npc13_backstory_b|I saw of late the word of the Dark Lord spread among my kin, and in their hearts and minds his will crept. Most were drawn to his darkness, and in place of their courage grew an insatiable lust for slaughter so that when their ears heard his call few puppets were so willing to answer.
; str_npc14_backstory_b|There is much change in a man who rides the tumult of the winds and seas of the Belfalas waters, and those yet to battle her will are but children. For stout men are they who meet her tempest and ride her storm. I have laid eyes on her darkest tide and yet remain her master.
; str_npc15_backstory_b|Many moons ago, when I was just a fresh little thing, my Grandsire led the tribe down into the mines, where the dwarves had recently died. A Fire Wraith had passed through, and it was comfortable and warm. We prospered, but every so often some cruel adventurer, or Dwarf hero, would come and kill and maim us in our peaceful tunnels. My hands learned to close the wound of sword or axe, and my mind learned to see the outline of bone and sinew below any hide. These days, I can work a potion or set a break with equal skill.
; str_npc16_backstory_b|The Balcoth were a fierce race of men from my home land, slaughtered by these westerlings to all but a few men. Chased down like beasts of burden as food for their blades. The blood spilt by those blades is the same blood that flows within me, for within me their house continues.
; str_npc17_backstory_b|You can make many things out of the trees, you know. It's what I do. I work with trees and make things out of trees. Sometimes bushes also. But I like trees more.
; str_npc1_backstory_c|However, I fear we are hopelessly outnumbered here in Ithilien and we won't last long without reinforcements or bolder action by our Steward. I might as well help where my actions would account for more, if my Captain Faramir gives me leave.
; str_npc2_backstory_c|However important my duty here is, I'm quite anxious to see real combat and... elves and talking trees and oliphaunts! You seem well-travelled, commander, and I don't mean that as a slight on your appearance, not by a fathom. I learn quickly and can cook... well, good enough for soldiers that is. Am I not mistaken that you are looking for volunteers?
; str_npc3_backstory_c|So, here I am, disgraced and bitter. My éored must be miles away now, and I wouldn't have a fair chance of catching up with them, not with all the orcs and wildmen roaming the plains. Are you by any chance in need of a fine Rohirrim rider?
; str_npc4_backstory_c|You might know that women, however skilled, are not allowed to ride with the éoredas. However, I do not think that waiting by the hearth for the warriors to return is my fate. I will not sit idle until all chance of great deeds is gone in this War, and I would welcome your assistance, warrior.
; str_npc5_backstory_c|However, if the enemies of Lothlórien are on the run, I might consider joining you for a while, {playername}. I sense our fates in this War are interwoven.
; str_npc6_backstory_c|You wouldn't understand that, I think, seeing you prepared for war. But you must have travelled far and wide - have you seen the other great forests? Can you take me there?
; str_npc7_backstory_c|There is a lull in the fighting that ill-suits a dwarven warrior of my ancestry and temperament. I gather you get to see much more action in your travels and your cause is friendly with the dwarves? I know a fighting dwarf will greatly improve your chances of survival.
; str_npc8_backstory_c|I hear there is much fighting elsewhere and our lands are gratefully spared for now. From the scratches on your armor you must have been in danger many times. Maybe my humble skills could be better used with your company, for the greater good of all.
; str_npc9_backstory_c|I am a fighting Uruk-hai, and a berserker! What there is to know of killing men, I know it. I was in the service of the White Hand, but now the Hand would as likely throw me into the fire-pits.^^I would come with you and hunt men in the south, while the snagas of Isengard gnash their teeth.
str_npc10_backstory_c|Belki benim yeni ustam sen olabilirsin.
; str_npc11_backstory_c|All right, all right! My nose isn't much use. I reckon my eyes are better than my nose. Ai! But my nose is only no good cause it don't know what nothing smells like. It don't even know what it's looking for, I tell you. Ar! I just need to go lopin' off and start sniffing places.
; str_npc12_backstory_c|Eh, if I get a chance, I'll slip off and set up somewhere on my own with a few trusty lads, somewhere there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em, like old times.
; str_npc13_backstory_c|I followed my kin north, and heeded his dark call, to fulfill the duty I have to my people. But in them I see his darkness dwell and I seek to do my part in this war elsewhere, until the sands of my time no longer fall. Even now I feel them begin to trickle where before there was a cascade.
; str_npc14_backstory_c|But there comes yet the darkest tide, a black tide of shadow, which will rise over these lands such as which no mortal eyes will have seen. This is the tide I seek to master, but I am without a crew hardy enough to ride this storm.
; str_npc15_backstory_c|After many winters I came up out of the tunnels, and looked about in the Dark Forests for a good place to live and practice my arts. I was doing fine, until some big ugly bastards with white tattoos – eugh! White! Like an elf face! – big bastards, they were. They fired my little place in the Forest, and I had to hide in the caves again... In here... Say, have you anything to eat? Maybe a nice horse?
; str_npc16_backstory_c|That was many lives of men ago, a different time, but the time for grief and tales are over. The time for my people's retribution has come and I will carve my people's vengeance on the face of these western lands. By my hand, their homes will waste and wither until their clan is no more!
str_npc17_backstory_c|Ormana giriyorsan, belki oraya gidip sana oradaki ağaçları anlatırım? Çok ilginç ağaçlar var, biliyorsun.
; str_npc1_backstory_later|I have been leading scouting parties to the south, as far as Emyn Arnen. There is much Enemy activity and many an orc fell to our ambush. Alas, that's only so many orc heads rolling down the gullies, we saw a myriad of foul creatures on the march. I fear for my Ithilien and the fate of Gondor.
str_npc2_backstory_later|Son zamanlarda birkaç ziyaretçimiz oldu,gelecekte çok az kişi var.İşler kesat gibi bu sıralar.
; str_npc3_backstory_later|Still no news of my éored, and I'm keen on riding down some orcs.
; str_npc4_backstory_later|More riders return with their bodies broken, and I try to give aid where I can. But I still feel trapped in a cage.
; str_npc5_backstory_later|Have you reconsidered? The time for the Eldar grows short.
; str_npc6_backstory_later|I've been observing a nest of giant spiders for a couple of days. Ugly creatures, they seem at first, but they keep intruders at bay. Did you come to ask me to travel with you?
; str_npc7_backstory_later|Building up defensive walls is worthy of any dwarf. But I need to use my axe too. Soon. Let me come with you.
; str_npc8_backstory_later|I made another call to our King, this time for vomiting. I hope his resolve to engage the enemy is not related to his conditions. Do you suffer from constipation and vomiting too?
; str_npc9_backstory_later|What do you think I do? Gulm is sitting here and waiting for some sneaky snaga to stick him in the dark. Take me with you - I will serve well.
str_npc10_backstory_later|Yeniden inceledin mi? Ben iyi hizmet edeceğim.
; str_npc11_backstory_later|Ar! It was you! I smelt you, I knew you were coming. Tell the Bosses that, will ya? They think since I was kicked out of the trackers that it's safe to flout me, well they're mistaken, I'll put an arrow in their guts first. And whose blames was that? Not mine!
; str_npc12_backstory_later|I have my orders. Any trespasser found by my lads up here are to be stripped; teeth, nails, hair and all. But I've got my watchers. We know there are funny things going on: with the big bosses going off to war, and all that. Big things going on away west, they say. Sitting here doin' nothing is more than my belly's worth.
; str_npc13_backstory_later|My role here goes well for the dark cause, and once more the Northerners fear the south. I see great victories ahead, and rivers of blood left in our wake. But with each victory I see my kin corrupted, their hearts twisted to his evil will. The sight of it leads me to despair.
; str_npc14_backstory_later|You have returned stranger, it is perhaps an omen. I have been reading the waters, and I have seen them darken. The sea changes the eyes of a man, and teaches him to use his eyes to listen to her language.
; str_npc15_backstory_later|Many have been the great ones who have begged to be healed by my potions.   Horselovers and the pale-faced elves are many though, and I have had to abandon my hut once more, and am... well, Great Lord, I am not so lucky as when we fought together, and you were grateful for my skills...
; str_npc16_backstory_later|Long does the history of my people recount these lands. I know not what their treacherous histories say of days when my people before entered this land, but sad and dark will their histories be as my people enter it now. Like a storm of hooves and swords and arrows, we will bring them doom like the Balcoth before us.
; str_npc17_backstory_later|I've seen a very old pine the other day. Pines can get very old. You have to respect old trees. But I've also seen some that don't respect trees at all. You respect trees, don't you?
; str_npc1_backstory_response_1|If you can get leave, I have much need of an experienced warrior and a tracker.
str_npc2_backstory_response_1|Haklısın, Bir kaç gönüllü arıyorum.
str_npc3_backstory_response_1|Bira olmadan yapabiliyorsanız, iyi bir atlıya hoş geldiniz diyorum.
; str_npc4_backstory_response_1|I would welcome the help of a Rohan shieldmaiden, if offered.
; str_npc5_backstory_response_1|It may be presumptuous of me to ask, but my company could use your skill in the coming battles.
; str_npc6_backstory_response_1|We travel the world, but to defend all that is fair, we give battle to the enemy.
; str_npc7_backstory_response_1|Indeed, a dwarven warrior would be welcome in my company.
str_npc8_backstory_response_1|Sağlıkçıyı ve şifacıyı kullanabiliriz.
str_npc9_backstory_response_1|Sanırım bir Berserkeri iyi kullanabiliriz.
str_npc10_backstory_response_1|Yapıcaksın.
str_npc11_backstory_response_1|Nasıl gidiyor benimle?
str_npc12_backstory_response_1|Nasıl benimle dalga geçersin.
str_npc13_backstory_response_1|Beni takip etmeye ne dersin ?
str_npc14_backstory_response_1|Bana katılmaya ne dersin ?
str_npc15_backstory_response_1|Aha ... Bir şifacı , ha ? Ve bu işte iyiyim , diyorsun? Senin gibi birini kullanabilirim.
str_npc16_backstory_response_1|Burada Ne Yapıyorsun?
str_npc17_backstory_response_1|Peki, her zaman ağaçlar hakkında daha fazla bilgi edinebilirsiniz. Sizinle birlikte yaşadığımız için mutluyuz.
str_npc1_backstory_response_2|Bunu duyduğuma üzüldüm. Umarım inancın cesaretini güçlendirir.
str_npc2_backstory_response_2|Hayır, üzgünüm. Ben tecrübeli savaşçılara bakıyorum.
str_npc3_backstory_response_2|Hayır, üzgünüm. Ben Daha Güvenilir Birisini Aramıştım. 
str_npc4_backstory_response_2|Üzgünüm , leydim. Ama yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yok.
str_npc5_backstory_response_2|Lothlórien daha ez tehlikede olduğu zaman döneceğim.
str_npc6_backstory_response_2|Hayır, üzgünüm. Askı takamayız.
str_npc7_backstory_response_2|Hayır, üzgünüm. Kendi başımıza iyiyiz.
str_npc8_backstory_response_2|Hayır, üzgünüm. Biz şifacıları sadece ihtiyaç duyduğumuzda ziyaret ederiz.
str_npc9_backstory_response_2|Hah. Ben hainlere güvenmem.
str_npc10_backstory_response_2|Sana ihtiyacım yok, köle.
str_npc11_backstory_response_2|Seni duymak istemiyorum korkak.
str_npc12_backstory_response_2|Büyük Patronlar en iyisini bilir. Sen en iyisi emirleri takip et.
str_npc13_backstory_response_2|Bu acı çekmek için olan kaderin.
str_npc14_backstory_response_2|Ben bunlardan yeterince aldım.
str_npc15_backstory_response_2|Hayır! Bizim savaşçılara ihtiyacımız var, kundakçılara değil.
str_npc16_backstory_response_2|Ben bunlardan yeterince aldım.
str_npc17_backstory_response_2|Hayır, üzgünüm. Savaşa çıkıyoruz, botanik yolculuğa değil.
; str_npc1_signup|I am sure Captain Faramir would understand there are others who can keep the Enemy at bay with even more valor and courage.
str_npc2_signup|Ah, ne güzel bir gün! Senin birliğine katılmaktan memnun olurum.
; str_npc3_signup|Trust me, commander, all the ale I need is the sweet drink of victory. If you can lead me against the enemy, they will soon feel the business end of a Rohirrim spear!
str_npc4_signup|Bu hoş bir teklif, ve beni birliğine davet edebilirsin, komutanım.
; str_npc5_signup|I see. I admit I have heard of you and your exploits.
str_npc6_signup|Şiddetten ve savaş silahlarından hoşlanmam, ama kendimi hızlıca nasıl savunacağımı biliyorum.
; str_npc7_signup|I am skilled with an axe, both the wielding and the throwing type. I can also keep your bills low if you let me talk to the merchants. And I have an eye for finding the best pieces of loot from fallen enemies on the battlefield.
; str_npc8_signup|Indeed? Well then, I merely need to gather my herbs and recipees.
str_npc9_signup|Bir savaşçı uruk siz bütün snagalardan daha değerlidir. Bir savaşçı uruk asla savaştan kaçmaz.
; str_npc10_signup|Really? You would do well to enlist me.
; str_npc11_signup|Follow your mob Ai? Ar! I hear about all these goings-ons out west, raids and all, and hundreds of our lads done in. I'll come and have a look with you all the same, and see what you're up to.
; str_npc12_signup|Follow your rabble, 'ay? I may 'ave struck a bit of luck at last. I give a good rumble, I reckon, and my whip is vigilant. It's tasted its fair share of my lads' orc hide.
; str_npc13_signup|I may follow you if you will have me. My legs make good heading of a horse between them and my hands know well the feel of blades of the crescent moon. My fingers can make fall arrows like the plight of stars upon our enemy, be it on horse or feet, though how I fight will be at your command.
; str_npc14_signup|Perhaps, know though that I am no thief or brigand. I will not steal, nor take that which other lives may find needed.
str_npc15_signup|Heh-heh. Haklısın! Ve çok akıllısın, Büyük Kaptan.
; str_npc16_signup|I wait for orders, with every second passing darkening my heart. I can no longer stand to wait for the plans of far away lords and captains so unseen their existence is believed more in legend than in flesh. Lords whose whispered orders are brought forth and shouted by lesser men. I wait, and with me, my people's vengeance waits also.
; str_npc17_signup|Very good! I know many trees. Soon you will know many trees too. Like me. Because I know many trees.
; str_npc1_signup_2|It would take a moment to talk to my Captain and gather my things.
; str_npc2_signup_2|I'll need to talk to my Sergeant first and then off we go - there are glorious battles to be fought and all manners of strange creatures to see!
; str_npc3_signup_2|I've been waiting for someone to take me on, so I only need to saddle up my horse and we are ready to ride.

; str_npc4_morality_speech|Take no heed to what the soldiers say, sometimes to {s21} is the wisest course of action. I for one appreciate the lives spared and limbs unbroken, if for nothing else but to fight another day, when fate looks upon us with favor.

; str_npc7_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honour for any right-thinking dwarf, but to fight in a company led by a coward is a disgrace. What will my cousins say if they learn of this?

; str_npc17_rehire_speech|Hey. Time to move on again? Trees don't move much. But I like to move. But I like trees too.
; str_npc1_home_intro|Captain, we are approaching Osgiliath now, so let us be on the lookout for friend and foe alike.
; str_npc2_home_intro|Be vigilant, commander, that must be Minas Morgul over there. Do you feel that something is watching us?
; str_npc3_home_intro|A word of advice, commander. We are getting mighty close to Entwood now and the horses are getting restless. Some call the forest Fangorn, too.
; str_npc4_home_intro|Let's stop here for a minute, commander. Ahead of us, between the Anduin and the Limlight, lies the Field of Celebrant, where Eorl the Young rode to the aid of our Gondor allies.
; str_npc5_home_intro|Daro! That's Isengard and the black tower of Orthanc ahead. Much have changed since I last saw them, and none for the better.
; str_npc6_home_intro|Excuse me, {playername}. The paths in this part become more twisted and some lead to dead-ends. We must be approaching Dol Guldur.
; str_npc7_home_intro|Oy, captain! This must be the old path to the Eastern Gates of Khazad-dûm, or Moria as you may prefer. You can see in the distance the glittering lake of Kheled-zâram, and, through the clouds, the three peaks known to grace this part of the Misty Mountains.
; str_npc8_home_intro|Oh, a curious sight! I heard stories about this place where sturdy woodmen are said to live in harmony with animals and plants. Beornings they are called, I gather.
; str_npc9_home_intro|Curses! That must be Hornburg over there, master.
str_npc10_home_intro|Hey, şuraya bak !

; str_npc17_home_intro|Ooooo, mallorns grow here! One should never cut down a mallorn, they're just too beautiful!
; str_npc1_home_description|It was a fair city once, the capital of Gondor of old, full of people and laughter. Now it lies deserted and ruined, the old Anduin flowing wearily through a ghost town.
; str_npc2_home_description|It was called Minas Ithil many years ago, and stories are told of how moonlight filled its inner courts with silver light and its walls gleamed silver and white. Gondor watchmen peered over the walls to the east and kept watch beyond Ephel Dúath.
; str_npc3_home_description|It's thick with trunks and branches and all manner of trees, and I wouldn't venture there as strange creatures roam the forest, not all of them harmless.
; str_npc4_home_description|'Where now the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing?^Where is the helm and the hauberk and the bright hair flowing?...^They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;^The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow...'
; str_npc5_home_description|Once built by the Southern Kingdom, now home to one that we called the White Wizard, scheming, no doubt, how to increase his power further at the expense of others.
; str_npc6_home_description|I have never ventured this far, but I overheard our Greenwood scouts say there may be Nazguls here. I feel an evil presence, but I cannot put a name to it. It is powerful, though, so let us be prepared.
; str_npc7_home_description|Judging by the desolation, and the many orc-tracks, I fear for the fate of the courageous Balin and his expedition. It seems that Moria has fallen to the Shadow and we should tread carefully.
; str_npc8_home_description|Not too often, a travelling merchant comes to the Dale market and offers the finest honey I have ever tasted. For some curious reason, he says that 'it was made by bears' and laughs.
; str_npc9_home_description|Its damned walls are too high and too hard for my hammer to break. I reckon if we ever chase away the manlings from their Edoras pig-sties, they'll run off here and cower behind the walls.

; str_npc17_home_description|I didn't know there were such lovely woods here too. I wonder if any woodsmen work here.
; str_npc1_home_description_2|If Gondor is doomed, West Osgiliath shall fall first to the foul hordes of the Eye. I only hope Captain Faramir would be in command that day and stem the tide. If we could spare any men to bolster the defences here, I would be most grateful, Captain.
; str_npc2_home_description_2|It is said it's full of terrible orcs now and dread spirits and worse. I pray for the day when Gondor will reclaim it and cleanse it of all things foul.
; str_npc3_home_description_2|If we must cross Entwood, let us do so with haste and stealth. I don't know who might be listening to our hooves and I don't care to find out.
; str_npc4_home_description_2|We would do well to remember the great deeds of the past and the sacrifices that were made. The Alliance between Rohan and Gondor shall save our peoples from doom once again.
; str_npc5_home_description_2|Let it be a reminder that even the greatest, even one of the Istari, can be corrupted and fall. Those who lust for power can be defeated by power, so let us not tarry much longer.
; str_npc6_home_description_2|I sense the evil armies behind its walls prepare to march... To fair Lothlórien? To Dale? To my Greenwood homeland? I cannot tell, but please do everything you can to thwart them.
; str_npc7_home_description_2|If the fates of war ever provide us with a large army, we should risk the entrance to the Mines and retrieve their mighty riches.
; str_npc8_home_description_2|I can smell the fragrance of many sweet flowers and see the bees harvesting their nectar. If you don't mind, I will gather some herbs for our own use, it will only take a moment.
; str_npc9_home_description_2|There's no use trudging around here if we are not backed by a large Uruk-hai horde. Unless you want to make faces at the lookouts on the wall, that is.

; str_rohan_rumor_7|I've seen breeds of the desert mare and Variag horse. Rohan horses are clearly superiour but require a more experienced rider to handle.

; str_rohan_rumor_12|We say in Rohan that a horse is like a man. That if a horse is good it is like a man is good, and that if a horse is bad, is like a man is bad. And if a horse is hungry is like a man is hungry, and if a horse is sad is like if a man is sad. And we say if a horse is happy is like when a man is happy. We say if a horse is angry is like if man is angry. We say if a horse walk is like when a man walk, we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old, and we say if horse is young is like when a man is young. And the same we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old. And if a horse small, is like when a man's small.

; str_gondor_rumor_5|The Shadow's resources for war seem limitless, but they are borne on the backs of a vast pool of slave labour.
; str_gondor_rumor_6|We know of the elves in the north, but nowadays noone gets to see them anymore.
; str_gondor_rumor_7|I would see the White Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens.
; str_gondor_rumor_8|Why does Umbar keep invading us? Their Corsairs would have profited far more from trading with us. What plunder could match the riches they'd have hauled away selling old Numenorian artifacts to Gondorian nobles?
; str_gondor_rumor_9|War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.

; str_gondor_rumor_17|There is a strange black rock near Erech. I went to see it once with my father. People say it's laid over a chamber where the last son of the sea kings sleeps. I think it's just a rock.

; str_lorien_rumor_8|It is said that the sea calls to everyone, sooner or later. I too shall hear the gulls one day, leave Laurelindórenan for good. I Harthon an lend and. 
; str_lorien_rumor_9|Av-'osto - do not be afraid! More than our grey cloaks protect us from the enemy here.
; str_imladris_rumor_begin|May the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you.
; str_imladris_rumor_2|May the stars shine upon your faces!
; str_imladris_rumor_3|He that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.
; str_imladris_rumor_4|We must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope it be.
; str_imladris_rumor_5|Despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.
; str_imladris_rumor_6|Even after the coldest winter flowers do spring. And after the longest night, comes a new dawn.
; str_imladris_rumor_7|So many had gathered when last I rode to war. The light of the drawing of our swords was like a fire in a field of reeds. So few have left Imladris now. 
; str_imladris_rumor_8|Áva rucë! The Eldar have taken arms to fight the enemy alongside brave Edain once more.  Perhaps for the last time, who knows? We sing of war, of fire and the end of the Night.
; str_imladris_rumor_9|I see the men from the East ride under the Dark Lord's banner and it is as though I watched their ancestors again - waves of horsemen shattering upon the gleaming shieldwall of the Last Alliance. If only the memory of Edain was as long as ours.
; str_woodelf_rumor_begin|An Elven-maid there was of old, /A shining star by day: /Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, /Her shoes of silver-grey.
; str_woodelf_rumor_2|Time does not tarry ever, but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves.
; str_woodelf_rumor_3|Darkness and evil creep over these once beautiful woods. Unless they are stopped, they will smother all hope, all light.
; str_woodelf_rumor_4|Quick and nimble, quiet and precise, we can yet keep the Darkness at bay. But how much longer?
; str_woodelf_rumor_5|Shhh, no dhínen! There may be orcs lurking around. We must be on guard!
; str_woodelf_rumor_6|*stares at you, obviously annoyed by your presence*
; str_woodelf_rumor_7|Oduleg hi am man theled? We need to know your purpose here. Sorcerer's spies are everywhere.
; str_woodelf_rumor_8|Edain of Dale make intricate toys these days! They've learnt much from the Naugrim.
; str_woodelf_rumor_9|The shadow of Dol Guldur is spreading. Dark creatures have been seen in the woods, our outposts attacked, hunters disappear and are never seen again. Our patrols now number at least 35 soldiers, we have grown that fearful!
str_dale_rumor_begin|Öncelerde burada bir ejderha vardı, ama şimdi...
; str_dale_rumor_2|As if the orcs coming from the north weren't bad enough, now the hordes from the east are upon us!
; str_dale_rumor_3|Ever since the defeat of the dragon, we know how to look for the enemy's weak spot.
; str_dale_rumor_4|Easterlings will never make it past us and our dwarven allies.
; str_dale_rumor_5|Have you ever seen the sun rise over the Long lake? The colours used to make my heart sing. But now all I see is a red dawn. A bad omen.
; str_dale_rumor_6|Dwarves are a bit too attached to treasures. We still don't know what to think of Thorin Oakenshield.
; str_dale_rumor_7|The men of Rohan are our cousins and our own language is very similar to theirs.
; str_dale_rumor_8|Esgaroth got its name from an Elven word for reeds, because of its reed banks. Did you know that?
; str_dale_rumor_9|The dragon was a sort of a monster noone wants to see ever again.
; str_dale_rumor_10|Our prosperity comes from trade with the Dwarves and the Elves. But it's hard to bargain with Dwarves. Very little profit there.
; str_harad_rumor_begin|The Black Snake will strike swift and deadly.
; str_harad_rumor_2|By the Serpent! Our beasts will trample Gondorians into the dirt.
; str_harad_rumor_3|Odum vermajál otí verthaba av daranaja-e-jatánus!
; str_harad_rumor_4|There is much gold and gems in Gondor. And even more in the lands beyond.
; str_harad_rumor_5|We will catch many western weaklings and sacrifice them to the Serpent God.
; str_harad_rumor_6|Corsairs have their uses, they sail well, but are rowdy and unclean in appearance and sneaky in behaviour.
; str_harad_rumor_7|I'd never set foot on a ship. Corsairs can have all the seas as far as I am concerned.
; str_harad_rumor_8|Warriors of Khand are fierce and fearless, but their strategy is too simple.
; str_harad_rumor_9|I'm counting on good loot in the West. We were promised it. Then I can return home and run my carpet shop in peace.
; str_harad_rumor_10|Keep away from the Mumakil. They are ill-tempered beasts and will squash you in an instant.
; str_harad_rumor_11|In Harad we have deserts and jungles, mountains and sea. Our peoples are as diverse as our lands and as numerous as the grains of sand.
; str_harad_rumor_12|Many knights from Harondor prefer sabres over straight blades. They're quite good for cutting down running peasants, but you need a spear or a good sword to penetrate strong armour.
; str_harad_rumor_13|My blood brother signed up with the Karka - he's a scout now. Riders of 'The Fang' lead a dangerous life, but it is good experience for young hot-headed boys.
; str_harad_rumor_14|Don't ever pick a fight with the Lion brotherhood! Their reputation is well earned.
; str_harad_rumor_15|I wish we had more weapons made of black iron. Many still have to manage with bronze, some even with wooden clubs and javelins of black glass, running into battle naked.
; str_gunda_rumor_begin|Take warm lands from men we come!
; str_gunda_rumor_2|Sharkû promised warm caves.
; str_gunda_rumor_3|Enough hiding in the cold mountains! Now we march into warm lands of men.
; str_gunda_rumor_4|We saw a slimy skulker in our mountain tunnels, but could never catch him. He just disappeared when we got close.
; str_gunda_rumor_5|The Isengarders think they're something special because the old man is equipping them.
; str_gunda_rumor_6|We will burn the villages of men to keep us warm.
; str_gunda_rumor_7|Manlings will feel the frostbite we will bring to them. And afterwards the fire. Ha ha ha!
; str_gunda_rumor_8|Azog and Bolg almost defeated dwarves, elves and manlings last time. But bird-monsters and bear-men saved them. *spit*
; str_gunda_rumor_9|Dwarf-flesh is tough and stringy. Man-flesh is better.
; str_gunda_rumor_10|Bear-men came from the woods and ate Boldush. Bad luck for Boldush! Ha ha ha!
; str_gunda_rumor_11|Some moved to Moria, much room there. But also Ghâsh in the deep. Best stay away!
str_moria_rumor_begin|Davulları duyunca, koş ve saklan!
str_moria_rumor_2|Ghâsh derinlerde!
str_moria_rumor_3|Doom! Doom! Doom! Davullar derinlerden geliyor.
str_moria_rumor_4|Moria büyük, ama cüceler artık burada saklanamıyor. 
str_moria_rumor_5|Cüceler çok derin kazdı. Bizim için her şey daha iyi. Ha ha ha!
str_moria_rumor_6|Moria'da birçok tünel var. hepsinden gidemeyiz.
; str_moria_rumor_7|Some manlings and dwarves sneaked past our sentries in the mines a while ago. We doubled the watch since.
str_moria_rumor_8|Cüceler buraya birdaha ayak basamayacak! Hiç bir zaman!
; str_moria_rumor_9|When we gather enough troops, we will go and burn down woods of elves.
str_moria_rumor_10|Moria'da fazla yemek yok. Biz açız. İnsanları ve elfleri yakalamalısın!
; str_moria_rumor_11|Some go to the forest in the south. None come out.
; str_umbar_rumor_begin|All the seas will belong to the black sails!
; str_umbar_rumor_2|There's no Gondor ships left to sink, now we go plunder inland.
; str_umbar_rumor_3|Umbar is our fate! And it will be Gondor's too.
; str_umbar_rumor_4|Gondorians can't sail! They've got land-legs.
; str_umbar_rumor_5|We've killed Gondorian kings in the past. Now they don't even have a king for us to kill.
; str_umbar_rumor_6|The sneaky Gondorians burned our fleet years ago. Now it's Gondor that'll burn.
; str_umbar_rumor_7|Nothing the sea can throw at us frightens a corsair. But we heard some disturbing rumours about abominations on land.
; str_umbar_rumor_8|We will spill over Gondor like a giant wave and reclaim our long lost lands.
; str_umbar_rumor_9|Haradrim don't drink rum. Did you know that? We like some, to steady the harpoon hand.
; str_umbar_rumor_10|I saw some Variags of Khand fighting. I wouldn't want to be facing them in battle. It is a good thing they are on our side.
str_khand_rumor_begin|Kavga, ne kadar kanlı olursa olsun, kavga demektir. Ancak geri çekilme en büyük utanç!
str_khand_rumor_2|Kılıçlarımızı bir kere çizdiğimizde kan bulması lazım!
; str_khand_rumor_3|The ground trembles under our heavy cataphract cavalry, but our enemies tremble at the mere mention of us!
; str_khand_rumor_4|This time we left the Wainriders behind, our attack will catch the enemies off guard.
; str_khand_rumor_5|We are the Variags of Khand, the fiercest warriors anywhere!
; str_khand_rumor_6|Rhun warriors are fierce too, but they fight on horseback, we rather maul our enemies on foot.
; str_khand_rumor_7|We have fought Gondorians in the past, this time we will finish them for good!
; str_khand_rumor_8|The West is weak and decadent. They have no warrior spirit. They will fall to our swords and axes.
str_khand_rumor_9|Bizler altın yada köleler için değil, Bizler onur ve şan için savaşırız!
; str_khand_rumor_10|The men of the West are arrogant, they do not know what might they are facing!
str_khand_rumor_11|Bazen Rhun, Mordor ve Harad la ticaret yaparız. Bazen de savaşırız. Bu bizim kanımızda var.
; str_khand_rumor_12|Have you made your warrior mask yet? You'll need one soon! If the enemy can't see your face, his spirit won't be able to find you.

; str_good_rumor_6|The Shadow that bred can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don't think it gave life to the orcs, it only ruined them and twisted them.
